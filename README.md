# Anomaly-Detection-in-Aviation-Using-Autoencoders
Developed an autoencoder model to detect anomalies in aircraft flight data during the critical final approach phase, aiming to enhance aviation safety. Utilized the DASHlink dataset containing flight data from approximately 99,000 flights, with variables like airspeed, altitude, and flap positions.
